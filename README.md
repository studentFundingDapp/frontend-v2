DSFS is a digital donation platform with a focus on transparency, community, and impact, specifically designed to fund student-led projects or support student needs—like tuition, innovation, or community-driven ideas. What makes it different is that it’s not just another GoFundMe clone—this thing is decentralized and tech-driven, probably aiming to integrate blockchain principles or community validation mechanisms later on.
